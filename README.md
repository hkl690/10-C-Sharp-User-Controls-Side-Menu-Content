# 8-C-Sharp Storyboard Animations
 
Creating a simple pop-up Window with menu commands and can be resized. A logo is added in the title for customization. The login textbox has been animated to slide in from the right and fade out to the left when pressed. The "next" button changes color from orange to blue when the mouse hovers over it.

This is an ongoing project from a C# WPF tutorial.
