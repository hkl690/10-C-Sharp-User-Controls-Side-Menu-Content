# 10-C-Sharp User Controls Side Menu Content
 
Creating a simple pop-up Window with menu commands and can be resized. A logo is added in the title for customization. A side menu is being added that will continue to be updated in the next upcoming projects.

This is an ongoing project from a C# WPF tutorial. 

Newest update - adding a side menu (still working on):

Sample output when pressing Login, the button shows a spinning icon (supposed to represent waiting, will need to try to fix the imagery in upcoming version):
